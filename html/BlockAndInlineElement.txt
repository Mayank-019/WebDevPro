In HTML, elements can be broadly categorized into two types: block-level elements and inline elements. These two types of elements behave differently when displayed on the web page.

1. Block-Level Elements
Definition: A block-level element takes up the full width available to it, causing a "block" to be formed. It always starts on a new line and stretches across the entire width of its parent container.

Behavior:

It forces a line break before and after it (meaning it will push other elements down or to the side).
You can set width and height properties for block-level elements.
Examples:

<div>
<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, etc. (headings)
<p> (paragraph)
<ul>, <ol>, <li> (lists)
<form>, <header>, <footer>, <section>, <article>
Usage: Block-level elements are typically used for structuring the layout of a page, such as creating sections, paragraphs, or divs that group content together.

Example of a block-level element:

html
Copy
<div>
  <h1>Heading Example</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph inside a div element.</p>
</div>
2. Inline Elements
Definition: Inline elements do not start on a new line. Instead, they only take up as much width as necessary to fit their content. They appear alongside other inline elements or text on the same line.

Behavior:

They do not force line breaks before or after them.
Inline elements cannot have their width or height set.
Examples:

<span>
<a> (anchor)
<strong>, <em> (text formatting)
<img> (image)
<code>, <i>, <b>
Usage: Inline elements are generally used for formatting small chunks of content within a block element, like adding links to text or making part of a paragraph bold or italic.

Example of an inline element:

html
Copy
<p>Click <a href="https://example.com">here</a> to visit our website.</p>
Key Differences Between Block and Inline Elements:
Feature	Block-Level Element	Inline Element
Display behavior	Starts on a new line and takes full width.	Does not start on a new line, takes only the width it needs.
Width and Height	Can have width and height set.	Width and height cannot be set.
Common usage	Used for structuring the page (sections, divs, paragraphs).	Used for styling or linking parts of text.
Examples	<div>, <p>, <h1>	<span>, <a>, <img>
Combining Block and Inline Elements
Block elements can contain inline elements inside them.
Inline elements cannot contain block elements because inline elements cannot break the flow of the page or create a new block.
Example of combining both:

html
Copy
<div>
  <p>This is a paragraph. <span>This part is inline.</span> Continue the paragraph.</p>
</div>
In this example, the <span> element, being inline, is placed inside the block-level <p> element.
